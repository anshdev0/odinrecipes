Hello!! This is my first project. In this project, i will be creating a website using HTML which will have links to certain recipes. 

By doing this project i will display and enhance my skill in HTML programming and website creation.

Thank you.

Edit : 
I have finally completed the project. It was a fun session. I learned many things and they are as mentioned below:
1. I learned how to make a repository and clone it to my local machine.
2. I learned how to write HTML Boiler plate and use various tags like heading, paragraph, anchor tags, image and break the line.
3. I learned how to commit and push the code I had written to GitHub so it can be saved not only on my laptop.
4. I learned how to publish my website even from a private repositories.

So yeah it was fun and I look forward to future endeavours.
